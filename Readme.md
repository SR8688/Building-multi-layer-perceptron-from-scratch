# *Building a multi-layer perceptron from scratch*

## Overview

-   Implemented a multi-layer perceptron to distinguid between 4 classes *without* using existing libraries like Tensorflow, Keras, or PyTorch.
-   Number of nodes in the hidden layer and learning rate can be specified.
-   An accurcy of 95.96% is achieved on hand writing dataset containing 4 classes.
